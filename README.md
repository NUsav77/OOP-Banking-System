# Mini Bank Object-Oriented Programming Project

An object-oriented program focused on replicating a simple version of a banking system. The program uses two .py files, accounts.py and users.py. 

Parent class User initializes the first and last name of the user, along with an optional social-security number. Users child classes Customer and Employee allow creation of Customers and Employee, as well as provide respective attributes and methods which mirror real-life banking systems.

Parent class Account initializes an account, while child classes CheckingAccount, SavingAccount, CreditCardAccount, and LoanAccount provide the respective attributes and methods of each class.
